# UI/UX Gaps

## Visual Inconsistencies
- Terminal window corners don't match the design system's border radius
- Inconsistent spacing between command output and input

## Interaction Issues
- No visual feedback when command is being processed
- Tab completion doesn't show available options
- No loading state for AI responses (only text appears)

## Accessibility
- Missing ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Color contrast could be improved for better readability
- Keyboard navigation could be enhanced

## Mobile Experience
- Terminal width doesn't adjust well to smaller screens
- Touch targets could be larger for mobile users
- Virtual keyboard covers input on some devices

## Performance
- Animations may cause jank on lower-end devices
- Initial load time could be optimized
- Memory usage increases with command history
